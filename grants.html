<h1>Ruby New Zealand Community Grant Programme</h1>
<p>
  Ruby New Zealand is excited to announce that we are making a funding pool available for community grants of up to $5,000 each in 2020.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to the mahi of volunteers and support from event sponsors over the last five years, we’ve found ourselves with a chunky surplus that we’re unlikely to need to underwrite in-person events in 2020. We’re keen to get some of that money back into the community, supporting people and the Ruby open source ecosystem.
</p>
<p>
  Our goal with these grants is to support people in a time of recession, and to strengthen and extend the Ruby ecosystem and community in accordance with our charter and strategy.
</p>
<p>
  The money could go towards almost anything, including your own time. We expect any outputs to be released with an open license and made available publicly.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="https://forms.gle/7KktwvoXQQHQnhm19">Apply now through this form</a>. Applications close on July 19, but early applications are encouraged and we are able to make payments early.
</p>
<p>

<h2>
  Process
</h2>
<p>
  A grants subcommittee of the Ruby New Zealand committee will assess applications according to the criteria as they come in. Committee members who have a conflict of interest or close personal connection to a particular project will recuse themselves from assessing that application.</p>
<p>
  If your application is successful, we’ll work with you to publish some details of the project. We won’t publish your name or contact details without your permission. We will share some anonymous and aggregated details about the applications we receive, such as the number of applications.</p>
